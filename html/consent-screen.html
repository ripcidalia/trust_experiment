     Purpose: Displays the participant information and consent form
              before the experiment begins.
     Behavior:
     - Shown first upon page load.
     - Clicking “I consent — Start experiment” hides this screen
       and initializes the experiment sequence (via JS).
     Layout:
     - Centered vertically and horizontally using the `.center-outer` container.
     - Uses a `.card` for visual framing and readability.
     Accessibility:
     - Standard HTML semantics ensure screen reader compatibility.

    <h1>Participant Information & Consent</h1>

    <p>
      You are being invited to participate in a research study titled
      <strong>Trust in Human–Robot Interaction in Search-and-Rescue Scenarios</strong>.
      This study is being conducted by Pedro Rodrigues Correia da Silva from the
      Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft).
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of this research study is to collect data regarding how people make decisions
      and form trust in emergency situations where a robotic agent provides suggestions.
      The study will take approximately <strong>25–30 minutes</strong> to complete.
      The data will be used for research in a Master Thesis at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of TU Delft.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the study, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire and then perform
      a computer-based task in which you decide between different options (e.g., choosing a door),
      with guidance from a simulated drone.
    </p>

    <p>
      As with any online activity, there is a minimal risk of a data breach.
      To the best of our ability, your responses in this study will remain
      <strong>completely anonymous</strong>. No names, email addresses, or IP addresses are collected.
      The only data recorded are your responses and timing information within the experiment.
      Data will be stored securely and used exclusively for academic research purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time.
      You are free to omit any questions.
      If you wish to stop the experiment early, you may click the <strong>Exit</strong> button
      (shown at the top-right corner of the screen during the task) or press
      <strong><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd></strong> on your keyboard.
      At that point, you will be given the choice to either keep the data collected so far
      or to discard it entirely. Once the experiment is completed, the data is anonymous
      and cannot be linked back to you or removed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have any questions about this research, please contact
      Pedro Silva (<a href="mailto:P.RodriguesCorreiaDaSilva@student.tudelft.nl">P.RodriguesCorreiaDaSilva@student.tudelft.nl</a>).
      The responsible supervisor for this project is

    <p>
      Please note that this experiment works best on a <strong>desktop or laptop computer</strong>.
      While it can run on mobile devices, the interface may be harder to use, and results may be compromised.
      On desktop, the experiment will automatically switch to <strong>full screen mode</strong>, the recommended mode
      for completing the study. You can exit full screen at any time by pressing the <strong><kbd>Esc</kbd></strong> key.
    </p>
