     Purpose: Displayed when the participant ends the experiment early
              but chooses to keep their data.
     Behavior:
     - Triggered by selecting “Exit & keep data” in the Exit Modal.
     - Confirms that collected responses have been saved.
     - No additional interactions are available afterward.
     Accessibility:
     - Centered, high-contrast message readable on all devices.
     Styling:
     - Inline styling ensures proper full-viewport alignment and dark theme
       even if other CSS files are unloaded.
